# kerf

A minimal-but-real B-rep solid modeling kernel in Rust.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-kerf-brep-kernel-design.md` (in the parent
`code/` workspace) for the design.

## Status

- [x] M1 — Geometry foundations: workspace, primitives (Line, Circle, Ellipse, Plane, Cylinder, Sphere, Cone, Torus).
- [x] M2a — Line intersections: Line vs Line, Plane, Cylinder, Sphere, Cone, Torus + polynomial solvers.
- [x] M2b — Circle intersections (closed-form): Line-Circle, Circle-Circle (coplanar), Circle-Plane, Circle-Sphere. Harder pairs deferred to numerical fallback in M3.
- [x] M3a — Surface intersections (closed-form): Plane-Plane, Plane-Sphere, Sphere-Sphere, Plane-Cylinder. Plane-Cone, Plane-Torus, Cyl-Cyl, etc. deferred to M3b/numerical in M3c.
- [ ] M3b/M3c — Remaining surface pairs + numerical curve-surface and surface-surface fallback.
- [x] M4 — Half-edge topology + core Euler operators (mvfs, mev/kev, mef/kef) + validator. Ring operators (kemr/kfmrh) deferred to M4b.
- [ ] M4b — Ring operators (kemr/mekr, kfmrh/mfkrh) for solids with holes.
- [x] M5 — `kerf-brep::Solid` (topology + geometry) and `box_` primitive constructor.
- [x] M5b — `extrude_polygon(profile, direction)` for arbitrary convex N-gon prisms. Curved primitives (cylinder/sphere/cone/torus) and revolve are still deferred.
- [ ] M5c — Curved primitives + revolve.
- [x] M6a — Face-face intersection: per face-pair, compute clipped 3D segments. Foundation for full booleans.
- [x] M6b — Edge splitting along intersection segment endpoints. Both solids gain vertices at intersection points.
- [x] M6c — Face splitting: add intersection chords as edges via mef. Faces sub-divide where boundaries cross.
- [x] M6d — Face classification: per-face inside/outside/on-boundary against the other solid via centroid ray-casting.
- [x] M6e — Boolean selection + triangulated output. `boolean(a, b, op)` returns a triangle soup. Stitched B-rep output is a follow-up.
- [x] M7 — STL export (ASCII + binary). `boolean(a, b, op)` → `FaceSoup` → `.stl` file.
- [x] M8 — Stitched B-rep boolean output: `boolean_solid(a, b, op)` returns a connected Solid; recursive booleans now work.
- [x] M9 — CSG demo example: extrude → recursive boolean → STL output, validating full kernel.
- [x] M10 — API polish: `box_at(extents, origin)` constructor + `Solid::{union,intersection,difference}` method API.
- [x] M11 — Interior endpoint support: corner-cut Difference now works via mev-tail interior vertex insertion; per-face two-pass algorithm splits boundary endpoints in phase A, grows interior vertices in phase B, splices remaining chords in phase C.
- [x] M12 — Multi-shell stitch: nested-Difference produces hollow Solids with 2 disconnected shells.
- [x] M13 — cylinder primitive (with seam topology) + tessellator. STL output for curved solids.
- [x] M14 — cone primitive (apex + base topology, 2V/2E/2F) + tessellator fan triangulation.
- [x] M15 — sphere primitive (1V/0E/1F, empty-loop topology) + lat-long tessellator with polar triangle fan and equatorial quad strip.
- [x] M16 — torus primitive (1V/2E/1F, genus-1 topology with self-loop edges) + validator extended to accept any non-negative integer genus via Euler-Poincaré; toroidal quad-strip tessellator.
- [x] M17 — frustum primitive (truncated cone, 2V/3E/3F, cylinder topology) with lateral Cone surface; apex computed from seam-line / z-axis intersection. Generalises cylinder (equal radii rejected) and cone (top_r → 0 rejected).
- [x] M18 — Primitive zoo capstone: every primitive (box, prism, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus, frustum) tessellated and emitted to a single STL.
- [x] M19a — Wavefront OBJ output (mesh export with vertex dedup).
- [x] M19b — STEP (ISO 10303-21 / AP214) B-rep export. Preserves exact geometry (planes, cylinders, spheres, cones, tori, lines, circles, ellipses) as native CAD entities. Real CAD interchange.
- [x] M20 — `revolve_polyline(profile)` constructor for axisymmetric solids. Revolves an open polyline in the xz-plane around the z-axis. Profile must have ≥ 3 points with both endpoints on the z-axis and all interior points at x > 0. Produces N vertices, (2N-3) edges, and (N-1) faces — first and last faces are Cone surfaces (apex cones), middle faces are Cylinder (vertical segment) or Cone (tilted segment). Euler V-E+F = 2 verified at construction.
- [x] M21 — Visual gallery: `cad_gallery` example renders 13 STLs covering every primitive + every working boolean. Tessellator fix for `Cone` faces with 2 boundary circles (frustum / revolve middle faces) — previously fan-from-apex which left the lateral surface invisible. Screenshots in `screenshots/`.
- [x] M22a — Real CAD example models: chess pawn via `revolve_polyline` (7-point profile, 32 segments, 320 triangles), stair-step Mayan ziggurat (5 boxes, FaceSoup-merge fallback for face-to-face touching geometry), and L-bracket with chamfered corner (`union` + `difference`). Three new STLs + rendered PNGs in `screenshots/`.
- [x] M22b — Native serde format. `Solid` round-trips through JSON via `serde_io::{write_json, read_json}` with `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}` derives across geom/topo/brep types and `nalgebra/serde-serialize`. Slotmap parity-invariant gotcha fixed: `solids: SlotMap<SolidId, ()>` → `SlotMap<SolidId, bool>` so occupied slots no longer serialize to `null` (which slotmap's deserializer reads as vacant).
- [x] M22c — Software-rasterized shaded renderer (`scripts/render_shaded.py`): pure-Python/numpy Z-buffer + two-light Lambertian shading replaces matplotlib wireframe. Corner cuts, hollow shells, and curved surfaces (sphere, torus) render with proper occlusion. 17 screenshots re-rendered in ~14 s total via vectorized numpy rasterizer.
- [x] M23 — `cylinder_faceted(r, h, n)` n-gon prism approximation. All-planar topology, so STL is exact and the planar boolean pipeline applies wherever intersection segments meet on shared edges. Probed the curved-boolean limit (`box ∪ cylinder` panics in M11 phase B with interior-only intersection endpoints on the box top face) — full curved face-pair clipping deferred. Resolution-sweep example (n=4 → cube, n=32 → smooth) at `screenshots/cylinder_resolution.png`.
- [x] M24 — Three new revolve_polyline CAD models: bowling pin (8-pt profile, 384 tri), wineglass / goblet (9-pt profile, 672 tri), stepped lighthouse tower (12-pt profile, 11 lateral faces, 640 tri). All-revolve so they sidestep the curved-boolean limit; demonstrate revolve_polyline's expressivity for axisymmetric shapes.
- [x] M25 — Triangle mesh → Solid importer. `read_stl_binary_to_solid` and `from_triangles` build a half-edge B-rep from a flat triangle list via vertex dedup (1 µm grid) + directed-edge twin pairing. Each triangle becomes a `Plane` face. Rejects non-manifold input (boundary edges, T-junctions, duplicate directed edges). Box round-trips through STL bytes losslessly (12 triangles → 8V/18E/12F).
- [x] M26 — Booleans on imported meshes. Imported B-reps feed back into `union`/`intersection`/`difference` exactly like native primitives — every triangle face is a Plane surface. Closes the loop: build → tessellate → STL → import → boolean → STL. Tested for native↔imported and imported↔imported on overlapping boxes.
- [x] M27 — `kerf` CLI binary. `cargo run --bin kerf -- <union|intersection|difference> a.stl b.stl out.stl` runs an end-to-end boolean on any binary STL inputs the importer accepts. Screenshots: `screenshots/cli_union.png`, `screenshots/cli_intersection.png`.
- [x] M28 — Half-overlap difference fix. Two boxes shifted in x panicked in the stitcher because A's coincident-with-B face classified as OnBoundary and was kept, leaving the kept-face graph with an unmatched half-edge. Changed `keep_a_face(OnBoundary, Difference)` from `true` to `false`: the shared boundary is re-emitted via B's flipped face when needed. Adds `half_overlap_difference_yields_sub_box` regression test. CLI screenshot: `screenshots/cli_difference.png`.
- [x] M29 — ASCII STL reader + auto-sniff. `read_ascii` parses the `vertex x y z` lines (recomputing normals on import); `read_stl_auto` sniffs the first 5 bytes and dispatches to ASCII or binary, with a fallback for binary STLs that happen to start with the literal "solid" prefix. CLI uses `read_stl_to_solid` so `kerf union ascii.stl binary.stl out.stl` works regardless of input format.
- [x] M30 — `kerf` installable + pipeable. `cargo install --path crates/kerf-brep --bin kerf` produces a 625 KB release binary. `-` for any path reads stdin / writes stdout, so booleans chain via shell pipes: `kerf union a.stl b.stl - | kerf difference - c.stl out.stl`.
- [x] M31 — Wavefront OBJ importer. `read_obj` parses `v` and `f` lines, triangulates quads / n-gons via fan, supports `i/uv/n` slash-form face tokens and negative (relative) indices, ignores `vt` / `vn` / `g` / materials. `read_obj_to_solid` is the end-to-end importer. Box round-trips through OBJ losslessly (8V/18E/12F).
- [x] M32 — CLI extension-based format detection. `kerf union a.stl b.obj merged.stl` works — input/output formats are picked from the file extension (`.stl`, `.obj`); for stdin, the leading bytes are sniffed for `v ` / `f ` / `solid ` to pick OBJ vs STL.
- [x] M33 — Recoverable boolean errors. `Solid::try_{union,intersection,difference}` and `try_boolean_solid` wrap the boolean pipeline in `catch_unwind` and convert any internal panic (M11 phase B interior limit, non-manifold stitch input, etc.) into a `BooleanError`. CLI uses these so it exits 1 with a diagnostic instead of crashing on unsupported configurations like `cylinder ∪ box`. Original panicking variants kept for invariant testing.

Build the STL files with `cargo run --example cad_gallery`. Render to PNG with `scripts/render_captioned.py` (requires `numpy-stl` + `matplotlib` + `numpy`). Uses the Z-buffered shaded renderer (`scripts/render_shaded.py`, M22c).

## Crates

- `kerf-geom` — exact analytic curves and surfaces, intersection routines.
- `kerf-topo` — half-edge topology and Euler operators.
- `kerf-brep` — the kernel (geometry + topology + booleans + constructors).

## CLI

```bash
cargo install --path crates/kerf-brep --bin kerf
kerf union a.stl b.stl out.stl
kerf intersection a.stl b.stl out.stl
kerf difference a.stl b.stl out.stl
```

Inputs may be ASCII or binary STL; output is always binary STL. Use `-` for any
path to read stdin or write stdout, so ops can chain through pipes:

```bash
kerf union a.stl b.stl - | kerf difference - c.stl out.stl
cat scan.stl | kerf intersection - cutter.stl out.stl
```
