# kerf

A minimal-but-real B-rep solid modeling kernel in Rust.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-kerf-brep-kernel-design.md` (in the parent
`code/` workspace) for the design.

## Status

M1 (Geometry Foundations) — in progress.

## Crates

- `kerf-geom` — exact analytic curves and surfaces, intersection routines.
- `kerf-topo` — half-edge topology and Euler operators.
- `kerf-brep` — the kernel (geometry + topology + booleans + constructors).
